# Linear Regression using Numpy

This project is part of my will to understand and implement Machine Learning. My objective is to understand the key concepts firts and then start using Frameworks for it.

The first step in this journey is to implement a Linear Regression Model where given a certain dataset, I want to find the Line that Best Fits the data points.

### Prerequisites

To keep things simple, this project will use just two libraries in python, one to make math computations and other to plot the graph with the dataset and the Line of Best Fit.

So in yout Python3 enviroment just make sure that you have this dependencies installed.

```
pip install numpy
```
```
python -mpip install -U pip
python -mpip install -U matplotlib
```

### Running

To run this project just make sure that both, python file is in the same location as the Profit_X_Population.txt file

To run it just execute the following command line:
```
python3 LinearRegressionNumpy.py
```

## Results

The Hyperparameters are initialized randomly, so the final total cost may vary, but it should be close to 4.480...

The Line of Best Fit must be plotted dynamically with its change over time with the dataset behind it, so we can see the learning process happening.


## References

This project was heavily influenced by the Coursera Courses of Andrew NG, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Specialization. There are concepts applied here of both courses and the example and dataset is from the Machine Learning Course.
